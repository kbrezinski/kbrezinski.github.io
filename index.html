I currently work as a Water & Wastewater Treatment Designer at <a href="https://www.wsp.com/en-ca">WSP Canada</a>, where I develop water and wastewater treatment designs for municipal and first nation communities as a chemist-in-training (CIT). I am also a Ph.D student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://umanitoba.ca/">University of Manitoba</a>, where I am supervised by Prof. Ken Ferens. My research interests focuses on incorporating complexity into Deep Learning Architectures, Malware Classification and Combinatorial Optimization.

<p>
Previously I completed my M.Sc. in Civil Engineering from the University of Manitoba, where I was advised by Dr. Beata Gorczyca. Before that, I received by B.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Winnipeg.
